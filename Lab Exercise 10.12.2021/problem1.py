## Lab Exercise 10/12/2021 Problem 1
## Author: 
## This program contains a function that will calculate the affect of
## air drag on a car
def drag(mph):
    #define variables
    v = mph * 0.447 #convert mph to m/s
    density = 1.23  #density of air
    area = 2.5      #cross sectional area of front of car
    coefficientDrag = 0.2   #typical drag coefficient

    #calculate the force of drag
    #Add code here






    
for speed in range(0,201,5):
    print ("At", speed, 'MPH', drag(speed), "horsepower is lost")
