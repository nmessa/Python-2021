## Author: 
## This program will plot a function
from graphics import *

#Define a function f(x) = 0.00005X^3 - 0.03X^2 +4X +200
def f(x):
   #Add code here
   

#Create window and canvas
win = GraphicsWindow(400, 400)
canvas = win.canvas()

#define the minimum and maximum values
xmax = 400
xmin = 0

#Calculate the difference between points
#Add code here
   

#draw 400 lines
#Add code here
   
   

#wait to close window
win.wait()
