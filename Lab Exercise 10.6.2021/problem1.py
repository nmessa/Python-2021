## Lab Exercise 10/6/2021 Problem 1
## Author: 
## This program will display the force between two charged particles
from math import *

#This function will return the force between 2 charged particles
#and is provided with 3 parameters; charge1, charge2 and distance
#the particles are apart
def coulomb(q1, q2, r):
    #Add code here
    

#Get input from user (q1, q2, r)
#Add code here
    

#Pass parameters to function and print out the force in Newtons
#Add code here


    
#General information
#Charge of proton = 1.6e-19 coulomb
#Charge of electron = -1.6e-19 coulomb
#Two protons seperated by 1 micron will give a
#force of 2.3008620641249835e-16 Newtons

##Sample Output
##Enter the number of coulombs charge charge 1: 1.6e-19
##Enter the number of coulombs charge charge 2: -1.6e-19
##Enter the distance the charges are seperated (in meters): 1e-6
##-2.3008620641249835e-16 Newtons
